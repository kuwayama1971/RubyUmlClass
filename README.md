# RubyUmlClass

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/ruby_uml_class`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Setup
    for ubuntu
    $ sudo apt install plantuml

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add ruby_uml_class

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install ruby_uml_class

## Usage

    $ start_ruby_uml_class.rb

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
